## Hey Cardano!

### I decided to make the Proposed Cardano Constitution more "readable" and turned it into a better formatted PDF.
It has bookmarks, different text styles, and other improvements for a better UX. I hope it will help someone seeking an easier way to read the text before making a decision.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/jakubszyca/Cardano-Constitution-PDF/blob/3f7f714a1a6960d35a1dac258c4c24b685eec769/Proposed%20Cardano%20Constitution.pdf)

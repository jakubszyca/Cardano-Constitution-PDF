## Hey Cardano Community!

### Iâ€™ve taken the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution and made it more readable and user-friendly by formatting it into a polished PDF.
The document now includes bookmarks, improved text styling, and enhanced formatting to create a better and more visually appealing reading experience. I hope this helps anyone who wants a smoother and easier way to navigate and understand the constitution. This document will be regularly updated to align with the latest on-chain constitution.

*The current version reflects the constitution ratified in **Epoch 540.***
